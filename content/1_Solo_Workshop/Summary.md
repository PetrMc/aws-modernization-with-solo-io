## Workshop Summary

Throughout this workshop, we navigated a series of labs that built up our proficiency in managing and securing a microservices architecture with the Gloo Platform:

- **Starting with the Basics**: We initiated our journey by setting up the essential components of the Gloo Platform, laying a robust foundation.

- **Security and Traffic Management**: We delved into advanced topics like Zero Trust security and traffic policies, which are pivotal for modern cloud-native applications.

- **AI Integration**: We explored how to seamlessly integrate AI services, specifically leveraging the Hugging Face API, into our microservices architecture, demonstrating the flexibility of the Gloo Platform in handling complex AI interactions.

- **Secure API Key Handling for AI Services**: We implemented secure API key management for AI services, ensuring that sensitive tokens are handled automatically and securely, underscoring the importance of robust security practices when integrating AI capabilities into modern applications.

- **Hands-On Application and Troubleshooting**: The practical application of these concepts not only enhanced our understanding but also equipped us with skills for troubleshooting and optimization.

- **Insights with Gloo Dashboard**: The workshop culminated with the Gloo Dashboard, offering a visual and intuitive approach to managing our microservices ecosystem.

The knowledge and skills acquired in this workshop are essential for anyone working with Kubernetes and service meshes in a cloud-native environment. By mastering these concepts, you are well-equipped to build, manage, and secure advanced microservices architectures, including those that leverage cutting-edge AI technologies.

Thank you for participating in the Gloo Platform EKS Workshop. We hope this experience has been insightful and empowering, providing you with valuable tools and knowledge for your future endeavors in cloud-native technologies.
