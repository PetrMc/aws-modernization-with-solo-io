## Lab 4 - AI Integration

![Gloo Platform EKS Workshop Architecture Lab 4](/images/gloo-platform-eks-workshop-lab4.png)

In this lab, we will configure the gateway to forward requests to an AI external service. Technically, any service that responds to HTTP requests can be configured. For the ease of this specific lab, we will use the free [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/welcome) service. The requests sent to the lab environment will be intercepted by Istio and forwarded to the external AI service. To complete this lab successfully, you will need to obtain an API Token from your instructor or [online](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).

1. Create `ai-demo` Namespace to Host AI Related Objects:

    ```bash
    kubectl create ns ai-demo
    ```

2. Enable Port `8081` to the Environment:

   - Add port `8081` to the deployed Ingress Gateway:

    ```bash
    kubectl patch gatewaylifecyclemanagers.admin.gloo.solo.io istio-ingressgateway -n gloo-mesh --type='json' -p='[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/installations/0/gatewayRevision", "value": "auto"},{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/installations/0/istioOperatorSpec/components/ingressGateways/0/k8s/service/ports/-", "value": {"name": "http2-8081", "port": 8081, "targetPort": 8081}}]'
    ```

   - Apply Gloo `VirtualGateway` to handle requests arriving at port `8081` and being processed by AI applications. Also, add `RouteTable` for all routing to be delegated to `RouteTables` inside the `ai-demo` namespace:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: networking.gloo.solo.io/v2
    kind: VirtualGateway
    metadata:
      name: ai-ingress-gw
      namespace: gloo-mesh-gateways
    spec:
      workloads:
        - selector:
            labels:
              app: istio-ingressgateway
            namespace: gloo-mesh-gateways
      listeners: 
        - http: {}
          port:
            number: 8081
          allowedRouteTables:
            - host: '*'
              selector:
                namespace: gloo-mesh-gateways
    ---
    apiVersion: networking.gloo.solo.io/v2
    kind: RouteTable
    metadata:
      name: ai-ingress-rt
      namespace: gloo-mesh-gateways
    spec:
      hosts:
        - '*'
      virtualGateways:
        - name: ai-ingress-gw
          namespace: gloo-mesh-gateways
      workloadSelectors: []
      http:
        - name: ai-ingress-requests
          labels:
            ingress: all
          delegate:
            routeTables:
            - namespace: ai-demo
    EOF
    ```

3. Define `ExternalService` for Hugging Face API Endpoint:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: networking.gloo.solo.io/v2
    kind: ExternalService
    metadata:
      name: huggingface-api
      namespace: ai-demo
    spec:
      hosts:
      - api-inference.huggingface.co
      ports:
      - name: https
        number: 443
        protocol: HTTPS
        clientsideTls: {}
    EOF
    ```

4. Create a `RouteTable` to Rewrite URL and Send Request to the External Service:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: networking.gloo.solo.io/v2
    kind: RouteTable
    metadata:
      name: direct-to-huggingface-routetable
      namespace: ai-demo
    spec:
      workloadSelectors: []
      http:
        - name: demo-huggingface
          labels:
            route: huggingface
          matchers:
          - uri:
              prefix: /huggingface
          forwardTo:
            pathRewrite: /models/openai-community/gpt2
            hostRewrite: api-inference.huggingface.co
            destinations:
            - kind: EXTERNAL_SERVICE
              ref:
                name: huggingface-api
              port:
                number: 443
    EOF
    ```

5. Test the Setup:

   - Assign the token received from your instructor or issued [online](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) to an environmental variable:

    ```bash
    export HF_API_TOKEN=<huggingface token>
    ```

   - Assign the Ingress gateway address and port to an environment variable:

    ```bash
    export GLOO_AI_GATEWAY=$(kubectl -n gloo-mesh-gateways get svc istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].*}'):8081
    printf "\n\nGloo AI Gateway available at http://$GLOO_AI_GATEWAY\n"
    ```

   - Confirm that the `API Token` is valid and that the service request sent to the Ingress Gateway managed by Gloo Platform returns a response from the upstream LLM service:

    ```bash
    curl http://$GLOO_AI_GATEWAY/huggingface \
        -X POST \
        -d '{"inputs": "Explain in 1-2 sentences why EKS value significantly increases when Gloo Mesh is added"}' \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer ${HF_API_TOKEN}"
    ```

This lab has demonstrated the process of integrating AI services with your Gloo Platform on EKS. By configuring external services and routing rules, we've enabled the platform to forward requests to the Hugging Face API, allowing seamless AI integration. This capability is vital in modern applications, where leveraging AI services can significantly enhance functionality and user experience. The skills gained in this lab will be instrumental in managing more complex AI integrations and routing scenarios in your microservices architecture.
